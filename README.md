## What is ZBLS?
**Zborowski-Bruchem Last Slot (ZBLS)** is the penultimate step in the [ZB Method](https://www.speedsolving.com/wiki/index.php/ZB_method) used to solve a 3x3 Rubik's Cube. It involves solving the last F2L pair while simultaneously orienting all last layer edges, allowing solvers to execute a ZBLL algorithm during last layer. ZBLS can be applied to all four F2L slots, but is most commonly used when solving a pair in the front right (FR) or front left (FL). There are 302 cases in total, with multiple edge orientation combinations existing for each possible F2L case.

The cases and algorithms provided in the ZBLS trainer are specifically used to solve cases in FR, but users can mirror or use a different algorithm for FL cases.

## Usage
### Selecting Cases
Click on the F2L groups to view the specific ZBLS cases for the group. Select the cases you would like to train.
All of the cases for a specific F2L group can be selected by clicking the checkbox beside the cases. 
To select or deselect every case, click _Select All_ and _Deselect All_ respectively.

### Creating Presets
Select the desired cases and click _Save_ to create a preset. Use the dropdown menu to apply and delete created presets.

### Training Algorithms
Click the _Start_ button to practice the selected cases in a random order, or click _Recap_ to view each case once.
Use the spacebar to start/stop the timer, or tap the screen if using on a mobile device.
When in recap mode, click _Again_ or press Backspace to practice the previous case again.
